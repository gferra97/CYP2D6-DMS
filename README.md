# Deep mutational scan of CYP2D6 using click-seq

## Overview
This repository contains two folders, one named click-seq and one named EOMCC. Both of these contain scripts to compute and analyze functional activity scores for CYP2D6 variants based on each respective assay (click-seq and EOMCC).

## Notes
This README.md will be updated soon.
