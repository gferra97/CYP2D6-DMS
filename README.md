# Deep mutational scan of CYP2D6

## Overview
This repository contains analysis code focused on a deep mutational scan of the pharmacogene CYP2D6. High-throughput functional activity scores were generated using two complementary assays: Click-seq and EOMCC.

The repository is currently organized into two main directories:

- `Click-seq/` – scripts for computing and analyzing CYP2D6 variant activity scores derived from Click-seq experiments  
- `EOMCC/` – scripts for computing and analyzing CYP2D6 variant activity scores derived from EOMCC assays

## Notes
This repository is under active development.
